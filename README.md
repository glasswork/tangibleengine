# Tangible Engine
...the micro-site...

Code for the very simple, single-page Tangible Engine website.
git ignores dokuwiki folder

The styles are all in the index.php file itself right now - this was valuable for speed of development since there was so little time in which to get this done. It is also good for page load and server bandwidth so I might leave it like it is.

There is also no real reason for the page to be php - it would take another small burden from the server to make it an html file. I might do that soon.
