# Tangible Engine

Code for the very simple, single-page Tangible Engine micro-site.

Note - git ignores dokuwiki folder.

The styles are all in the index.html file itself right now - this was valuable for speed of development since there was so little time in which to get this done. It is also good for page load and server bandwidth so I might leave it like it is.
